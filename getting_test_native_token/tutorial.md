# Getting Native Test Tokens

## Why Do You Need Native Tokens

In blockchain, we use gas fee as a counter measure for DOS attacks. So, for every transaction, we are paying certain amount of gas fee. This gas we paid in native token of the blockchain that is being used.

In this tutorial, you are working in `MATIC-MUMBAI` Testnet. So, you need to get some test MATIC.

## Getting The Test MATIC

At this stage, you should already have your `wallet address`. If you do not have it, you can get it from the `Check Wallet Status` lesson.

This address is your wallet address and you will use it to receive and send funds.

- Now, go to the faucet website: `https://mumbaifaucet.com/`.

- Put your wallet address into the text field.

- Click to the `Send Me MATIC` button.

- Afterwards, check your wallet balance again. You should see that instead of `amount: "0"`, you will have `amount: "0.2"`. Do not forget that you have two different token balances: one for `Native Token` and one for `USDC`. You should check the one for the native token, which should be the first one.

Now that you have some test tokens, you are ready for your first transaction.
