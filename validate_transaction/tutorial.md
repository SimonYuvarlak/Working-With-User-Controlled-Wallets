# Validating Transaction

Validating transaction thorugh the Circle's website is pretty simple.

- Sign in to your account in Circle's website where you acquired your API key.

- On the left hand side menu, if you scroll down, you will see `User Controlled` dropdown in the `Programmable Wallets` section.

- Once you click on the dropdown, you will see the option: `transactions`.

- If you click on it, you will see the transaction with their details on display including the status. A successful transaction will have the status: complete with a green background.

- If you click on a specific transaction, you can see more details about it.

Congrulations! So far, you have created a user controlled wallet, made a transaction by sending token from wallet to wallet and were able to verify this transaction. Sounds pretty good!
